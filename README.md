# Estimating the Jet Blast Area of Influence using RANS Turbulence Models

This repository contains the scripts developed for the thesis "Estimating the Jet Blast Area of Influence using RANS Turbulence Models" by Fidel Vargas (MSc Computational Fluid Dynamics, IRP - 2025). 
The scripts included here are essential for the measurements, analysis and plotting tasks performed in the thesis, with the aim the establish a relationship between the Reynolds Number and the area of influence
of the jet blast.
