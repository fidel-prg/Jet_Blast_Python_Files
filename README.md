# Estimating the Jet Blast Area of Influence using RANS Turbulence Models

This repository contains the scripts developed for the thesis "Estimating the Jet Blast Area of Influence using RANS Turbulence Models" by Fidel Vargas (MSc Computational Fluid Dynamics, IRP - 2025). 
The scripts included here are essential for the measurements, analysis and plotting tasks performed in the thesis, with the aim the establish a relationship between the Reynolds Number and the area of influence
of the jet blast.

# Python Scripts

- Centerline Velocity Decay: This plot is very important because it shows the relationship between the velocity in x- axis and the distance (It is used to determe the distance at which the velocity becomes harmful for ground airport personnel or other aircrafts. i.e. 35 miles per hour or 16 m/s).
  
- Normalized Axial Velocity Profiles: It is crucial to check if the turbulence models reproduce the experimental turbulence jet behaviour (In this case the Verhoff experimental reference)

- Normalized Radial Velocity Profile: The plot represents the lateral spreading, predicting the width of the jet blast spreading influence zone, which is crucial for airport safety regulations
